# README for Caesar Cipher

A simple implementation of Caesar Cipher, a method of encoding messages by shifting the letters in a given text. 

## How to use the code

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the cloned repository
3. Run the script using the following command: `python main.py`
4. Follow the prompts in the terminal/command prompt to encode or decode a message

## Features

- Encoding and decoding of messages using Caesar Cipher
- Input validation for encoding/decoding direction
- Ability to restart the program and encode/decode multiple messages

## TODOs

- Import and display the logo from `art.py` at the start of the program
- Add handling of shifts greater than the number of letters in the alphabet
- Add more features and customizations (e.g. different alphabets, multiple ciphers)
