# PyPassword Generator

A **simple password generator** created in Python that prompts the user to input the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password and generates a password with those specifications. 

There are two levels of password generation:
1. Easy Level - Order not randomized. The letters, symbols, and numbers are concatenated in the order they were specified by the user.
2. Hard Level - Order of characters randomized. The letters, symbols, and numbers are shuffled after they are generated.

***

## Usage

The user will be prompted to input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers in the password. The program will then generate and print the password.

## Requirements

- Python 3

***

## Note

The password generation is based on a random number generator, so the results will be different each time the program is run.
